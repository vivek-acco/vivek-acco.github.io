The prediction sites listed above are for the period of 30 days prospectively, based on available validated retrospective data sourced from the authorities. Primary data remain to be authority’s sole ownership and are not disclosed to third-party.</p> <p> 3. The monthly prediction sites and its accuracy range are predicted based on the above data, with the assumption that no intervention will take place on the sites. It is expected that once intervention takes place (e.g. fogging, larviciding, breeding sites clear up, etc.), and give effect to the lower chances of new cases taking place, AIME automatically correlates this with other variables (weather pattern, geographical features, wind direction, etc.) and therefore the predicted sites and its probability accuracy will vary. </p> <p> 4.
